# ComputationalCluster
Computational cluster for solving NP problems (DVRP included as an example). Developed as a university project.

The cluster uses custom TCP protocol based on XML messages.

The system consists of the following components:
- communication servers,
- computational nodes,
- task managers,
- computational clients,
- task solvers (problem-specific).
